                    We are a team of 4 currently who went through exactly what you guys are going through right now. Yes
                    even we were as confused as you were and we had to experiment a lot of things to know our taste and
                    interests, we had our fair share of feeling lows and lost and so we decided to help you people with
                    whatever knowledge we have gained and never let anyone feel lost as we did, we still are learning
                    and growing as this process never ends but for now, allow us to be your guiding torch :)
